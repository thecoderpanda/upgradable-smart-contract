# Upgradeable Smart contracts Hardhat Project

##This is a hardhat project that uses OpenZeppelin's transparent Upgradeable proxy system to implement upgradeable smart contracts.
The proxy is deployed at- https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x87e2fa2e862242c1d1aa0662ec8e3fa20132e8ed#writeProxyContract

Smart contract V1 - https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x7270555870acfb685dcec69a9f1ac161ad51f146#writeContract

Smart contract V2 - https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x3081c89122682b60043f8d6bdfdda0377e1a0cbc#writeContract


The first contract has only an increase counter function, while the second contract has both an increase and a decrease counter function.
